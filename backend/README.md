# open-banking-mobile-app
New Zealand Open-Banking mobile app that conveniently facilitates your banking needs in one place.

# Purpose for project
This personal project is my way of showing people interested in what I have been working on and capable of. I wanted to take the opportunity to create something that at minimum had all the components of what is considered a full-stack app that was also useful as well.

# Future Implementations
- Use Akahu's open banking api to retrieve user banking details
- Implement login backend
- Implement UI for bank transfer/payments

# Progress so far
